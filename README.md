# 🎲 Sudoku Solver App

This is a Sudoku solver app that uses recursive backtracking algorithm in Kotlin. The app features a simple UI created using Canvas and allows users to input the Sudoku puzzle and solve it with just a click of a button.

## 💡 How it works

The app uses a recursive backtracking algorithm to solve any Sudoku puzzle. The algorithm starts by finding the first empty cell in the puzzle, and then tries to fill it with a number from 1 to 9. If the number is valid, the algorithm moves on to the next empty cell and repeats the process. If the number is not valid, the algorithm backtracks to the previous cell and tries a different number. The algorithm continues until the entire puzzle is solved.

## 🚀 How to use

To use the app, simply download the code from the repository and run it in an IDE that supports Kotlin. Then, input the Sudoku puzzle in the UI and click the "Solve" button. The app will then solve the puzzle and display the solution in the UI.

## 🙏 Credits

This app was created as a part of my journey with [The Chance](https://github.com/TheChance101). The recursive backtracking algorithm was implemented by me, and the UI was created using Canvas.
